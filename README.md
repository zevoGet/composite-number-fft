# fft

this is my learn of fft , nothing but it is really interesting . 

This is the result of my learning,due to my passion of the NES game. First I wanna know how NES games work , so I goto their official website and download their open code.I have played the NES games all my primary school , and now I still love the games. As long as the Internet growing so fast, we are going to leave each other . I'd like to play NES game with partners in the other side of China, I need to share the screen and voice via the net , the problem is that voice always has noises , so I need to kick of the noises.

After learning FFT , I find that Fourier is really amazing person and the challenge fits me, so I show my learning in this website.

If you like the code , I hope the code can help
